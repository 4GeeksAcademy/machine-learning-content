    "**What is a feature?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature is typically a specific representation on top of raw data, which is an individual, measurable attribute, typically depicted by a column in a dataset. Considering a generic two-dimensional dataset, each observation is depicted by a row and each feature by a column, which will have a specific value for an observation. That said, a feature is a variable, which we can explain as any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. We call them variables because the values they take may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of variables may be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Age ( 10,15,17,21,30,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Country (USA, Thailand, Japan, Argentina,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy usage (220, 50, 130, 88,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "We classify variables in a dataset into one of these major types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Datetime variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mixed variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Features can be of two major types based on the dataset. Inherent raw features are obtained directly from the dataset with no extra data manipulation or engineering. Derived features are usually obtained from feature engineering, where we extract features from existing data attributes. A simple example would be creating a new feature “BMI” from an employee dataset containing “Weight” and \"Height\" by just using the formula with weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is feature engineering?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of using data domain knowledge to create and transform features or variables that make machine learning algorithms work more efficiently. It’s a fundamental task for improving machine learning model performance and prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering can be very time consuming because it includes a number of processes, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filling missing values within a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating or extracting new features from the ones available in your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoding categorical variables into numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need to do feature engineering?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we start a new machine learning project, whether we receive a raw dataset or we do web scraping to obtain the data, data will most certainly be messy and not suitable for training a model. We need to always perform some data exploration at the beginning to find empty values, outliers, data types, relationships,etc. After we understand better the data we have, we can start doing feature engineering tasks to build high performance models. The succeess of an algorithm can often hinge on how we engineer the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not confuse feature engineering with feature selection**. Feature selection allows us to select features from the feature pool (including any newly-engineered ones) that will help machine learning models make predictions on target variables more efficiently. In a typical machine learning pipeline, we perform feature selection after completing feature engineering."

    "\n",
    "Now if I’m building a recommendation system for song recommendations, I would just want to know if a person is interested or has listened to a particular song. This doesn’t require the number of times a song has been listened to since I am more concerned about the various songs he\\she has listened to.  In this case, a binary feature is preferred as opposed to a count based feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of working with raw, continuous numeric features is that often the distribution of values in these features will be skewed. This signifies that some values will occur quite frequently while some will be quite rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning, also known as quantization is used for transforming continuous numeric features into discrete ones (categories). These discrete values or numbers can be thought of as categories or bins into which the raw, continuous numeric values are binned or grouped into. Each bin represents a specific degree of intensity and hence a specific range of continuous numeric values fall into it.\n",
