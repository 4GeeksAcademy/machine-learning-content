    "In this exercise, we will have a brief introduction to the Scikit-learn library. We will see how this library can be used to implement the KNN algorithm in less than 20 lines of code.  Then the task will be to try to optimize the parameter of this algorithm. Don't worry! Scikit-Learn, and also de KNN algorithm will be explained very well in future modules.\n",

These are the attributes of specific types of iris plant. The goal is to predict the class to which these plants belong. There are three classes in the dataset: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.\n",
