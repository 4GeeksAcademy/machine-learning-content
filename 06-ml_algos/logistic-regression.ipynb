    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a linear classification algorithm. Classification is a problem in which the task is to assign a category/class to a new instance learning the properties of each class from the existing labeled data, called training set. Examples of classification problems can be classifying emails as spam and non-spam, looking at height, weight, and other attributes to classify a person as fit or unfit, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should we learn Logistic Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is the first supervised learning algorithm that comes to the mind of data science practitioners to create a strong baseline model to check the uplift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a fundamental, powerful, and easily implementable algorithm. It is also a very intuitive and interpretable model as the final outputs are coefficients depicting the relationship between response variable and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is logistic regression a regressor or a classifier?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is usually used as a classifier because it predicts discrete classes.\n",
    "Having said that, it technically outputs a continuous value associated with each prediction, by producing a probability score along with its classification prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that it is actually a regression algorithm that can solve classification problems.\n"

    "## What parameters can be tuned in logistic regression models?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several hyperparameters that can be optimized in Logistic Regression. To see all the available ones and their possible values, click: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html\n",
    "\n",
    "However, here we will show you the main hyperparameters we may tune in logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solver** is the algorithm to use in the optimization problem. The choices are {‘newton-cg’, ‘lbfgs’, ‘liblinear’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’}, and the default value is ’lbfgs’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *lbfgs* relatively performs well compared to other methods and it saves a lot of memory, however, sometimes it may have issues with convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *sag* faster than other solvers for large datasets, when both the number of samples and the number of features are large.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *saga* the solver of choice for sparse multinomial logistic regression and it’s also suitable for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *newton-cg* computationally expensive because of the Hessian Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *liblinear* recommended when you have a high dimension dataset - solving large-scale classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: ‘sag’ and ‘saga’ fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Penalty (or regularization)** intends to reduce model generalization error, and is meant to disincentivize and regulate overfitting. Technique discourages learning a more complex model, so as to avoid the risk of overfitting. The choices are: {‘l1’, ‘l2’, ‘elasticnet’, ‘none’}, and the default value is ’l2’. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: not all solvers support all regularization terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C (or regularization strength)** must be a positive float. Regularization strength works with the penalty to regulate overfitting. Smaller values specify stronger regularization and high value tells the model to give high weight to the training data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression offers other parameters like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- class_weight\n",
    "\n",
    "- dualbool (for sparse datasets when n_samples > n_features)\n",
    "\n",
    "- max_iter (may improve convergence with higher iterations), and others. However, these provide less impact."

    "\n",
    "Logistic regression uses maximum-likelihood estimation, which calculates the likelihood of one person being a survivor on Titanic, and then another one, and then another one. After all calculations are done, the model multiplies all those likelihoods and fits the S-shaped line to the data. Keeps calculating, until it finds the best S-shaped line. \n",

    "### The logistic regression equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Input values (x) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values (referred to as the Greek capital letter Beta) to predict an output value (y). A key difference from linear regression is that the output value being modeled is a binary values (0 or 1) rather than a numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example logistic regression equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = e^(b0 + b1*x) / (1 + e^(b0 + b1*x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where y is the predicted output, b0 is the bias or intercept term and b1 is the coefficient for the single input value (x). Each column in your input data has an associated b coefficient (a constant real value) that must be learned from your training data. This is done using maximum-likelihood estimation. The intuition for maximum-likelihood for logistic regression is that a search procedure seeks values for the coefficients (Beta values) that minimize the error in the probabilities predicted by the model to those in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual representation of the model that you would store in memory or in a file are the coefficients in the equation (the beta value or b’s).\n",

    "Ultimately in predictive modeling machine learning projects we are focused on making accurate predictions rather than interpreting the results. As such, we can break some assumptions as long as the model is robust and performs well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary Output Variable: This might be obvious as we have already mentioned it, but logistic regression is intended for binary (two-class) classification problems. It will predict the probability of an instance belonging to the default class, which can be snapped into a 0 or 1 classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove Noise: Logistic regression assumes no error in the output variable (y), consider removing outliers and possibly misclassified instances from your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaussian Distribution: Logistic regression is a linear algorithm (with a non-linear transform on output). It does assume a linear relationship between the input variables with the output. Data transforms of your input variables that better expose this linear relationship can result in a more accurate model. For example, you can use log, root, Box-Cox and other univariate transforms to better expose this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove Correlated Inputs: Like linear regression, the model can overfit if you have multiple highly-correlated inputs. Consider calculating the pairwise correlations between all inputs and removing highly correlated inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fail to Converge: It is possible for the expected likelihood estimation process that learns the coefficients to fail to converge. This can happen if there are many highly correlated inputs in your data or the data is very sparse (e.g. lots of zeros in your input data)."
