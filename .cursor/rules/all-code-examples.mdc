- If specific code examples are going to be included, use formatted code blocks like this:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

- If the code example is not in Python, use the appropriate language for the example.
- If the code example has all the code and context needed to run it, add "runnable" to the code block like this:

```python runnable=true
print("Hello, world!")
```

- If multiple code files or examples are needed, add them one after the other, each in a new code block with its own language extension, like this:

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```
```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
