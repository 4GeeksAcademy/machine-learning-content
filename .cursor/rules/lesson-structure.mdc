## How to start the lesson

Start the lesson with one or two paragraphs that grab the reader attention by stating a real life fact that shows how important are the topics the lesson will explain, for example, in a lesson about best practices when coding we can start like this: 

### Example 1:

Studies have shown that developers who use best practices when coding are up to 40% more productive than those who do not, and that code with good practices is up to 50% cheaper to maintain than code with poor practices.

## Example 2:

Companies and governments lose a lot of money every day because developers don't follow the best practices and guidelines. Here are some examples you can read more about:

- NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter was lost because the team was not using consistent metric system in the codebase, which led to confusion in the calculations, losing $320 million.
- The Ariane 5 rocket explosion by ESA was caused by bad code that was very difficult to read, and $370 million was lost
- The US stock market Flash Crash in 2010, with undisclosed significant financial losses.
- This lesson is a compilation of best practices that we promote at 4Geeks, it has been created and grown with contributions from all the community mentors.

## Use of headings:

- Don't use h1 headings at all.
- Use ## (H2) headings for main sections like “Introduction,” “Tools You’ll Need,” or “Common Pitfalls.”
- Use ### (H3) headings for subsections under the main ones.

## Follow a clear flow

- Begin with an overview, dive into details (prevention, tools, examples), and wrap up with a summary or next steps.
- Keep each section short and focused—don’t let it ramble.
