    "# Connecting to SQL databases using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As Machine Learning experts and depending on how the information is arranged, we will probably have to interact with SQL databases. It is a very common flow to ingest data in Python through SQL or non-relational databases and use Python to analyze it, graph it, define it and ultimately build a predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most commonly used SQL databases are SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL. SQLite is the best alternative when we want a portable database, without having to use a separate server to run it. It is ideal for embedded applications. If we want something more scalable in the future and a database for distributed applications, then MySQL is a good choice, while PostgreSQL is an opportune database for complex applications and is used in most enterprise solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparative SQL](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-content/blob/master/assets/comparative_sql.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will see how Python and some SQL databases interact. Why should we care about connecting Python and a SQL database? Perhaps, as Machine Learning experts, we need to build an automated ETL pipeline. Connecting Python to a SQL database will allow us to use Python for its automation capabilities. We will also be able to communicate between different data sources. We won't have to switch between different programming languages, we will be able to use our Python skills to manipulate data from an SQL databasea, Furthermore, we won't need a CSV file.\n",

    "Python has its own wrapper to make a connection to a SQLite database. Also, this package comes installed in the base version, and you don't need to install anything to start using it. Because the database is simple, so is its code:"
