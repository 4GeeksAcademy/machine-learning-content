# New York City Airbnb data

This is a dataset that contains Airbnb data on New York City. You will use it to practice your new EDA (exploratory data analysis) and data wrangling skills.

**Step 1:**

Go to the following online [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) . On the Data tab, download the dataset and put it in your 'Raw' data folder. Time to work on it!

**Step 2:**

Use the explore.ipynb notebook to find patterns and valuable information as much as you can. Make graphs that helps us understand the patterns found, get some statistics, create new variables if needed, etc.


-What can we learn about different hosts and areas?

-Which hosts are the busiest and why?

-Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

**Step 3:**

Now that you have a beautiful EDA notebook, and you have a better knowledge of the data, let's imagine Airbnb asks you to deliver a machine learning pipeline that cleans the data, in order to give it to their modeling area for price prediction.

Use the app.py to create your cleaning pipeline and make data ready for modeling. Save your clean data in the 'Processed' data folder.

We used to add our .env file into the .gitignore file in order to hide our passwords and credentials from version control. 

>This time make sure to add the data folder to your .gitignore file. Specially for big datasets, this is very important. 

In your README file write a brief summary of your cleaning process and explain where the data comes from. (Add the link)
